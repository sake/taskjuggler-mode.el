# taskjuggler-mode.el
An (old) Emacs mode for Taskjuggler files

[TaskJuggler](https://taskjuggler.org/) as an open source software for planning projects and scheduling tasks based on a project description. This description is given in a specific TaskJuggler fileformat. Way back, in the times of TaskJuggler 2x, the software had a desktop GUI using an editor component that I didn't want to work with. So, I wrote my own Emacs mode for it. For a while, it was shipped with TaskJuggler. In 2021 I received a request to publish the Emacs mode, because, apparently, it's not being shipped with Taskjuggler anymore. Likely, because it doesn't support TaskJuggler 3.x.

Its generic homepage is at https://www.skamphausen.de/cgi-bin/ska/taskjuggler-mode but that's about as maintained as the software itself. ;-)
